		<h1>What is Vantablack?</h1>

		<p>
Vantablack is a material made from carbon nanotubes that reflects virtually no light. It is considered the blackest black in existence. The rights lie with Surrey NanoSystems, which developed the substance for space and metrology applications. Vanta stands for vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays.</p>

<h1>Can I paint my car Vantablack?</h1>

<p>Clients can have Vantablack S-VIS applied by Surrey NanoSystems, or they can license the technology for their own production facilities. So no, you can't just buy a can to paint your car.</p>

<h1>What is the blackest black car paint?</h1>
<p>Why A BMW Painted With 'The World's Blackest Black' Is Unlikely To Hit The Road
The BMW X6 was selected as the first vehicle to receive the inky-black paint job and will debut in September's Frankfurt Motor Show.
Vantablack in its purest form absorbs all light, without reflecting any back.</p>

<h1>What does Vantablack do?</h1>
<p>Vantablack, for Vertically Aligned NanoTube Array, is made by “growing” carbon nanotubes on a metal surface. (A nanotube is a billionth of a meter thick, or about the width of three gold atoms.) Light is trapped between the tubes and bounces around until it's absorbed, so almost no light gets out.</p>	

<h1>How do you make Vantablack?</h1>


<p>If you want to try:
Make some 2 -3 nm diameter carbon nanotubes.
......Grind them up to a powder.
......Mix them into a clean, clear paint base like mineral spirits (latex is nice a eco friendly type thing instead).
......Paint your aluminum and see if it works.
......If it doesn't start again and vary the grind until it works.</p>
